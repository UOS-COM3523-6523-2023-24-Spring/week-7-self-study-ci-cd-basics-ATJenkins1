Notes:

I have two potential ideas on how we might test non-determinisitc functions.

1. Calculate an expected output and compare this to the average of multiple runs of the program.
   In the example given, the probability of True/False output is known. Therefore, we could calculate the expected
   output and compare this to the average output.

2. Rather than testing the final unpredictable output, we could implement tests that target specific values
   within the function in an attempt to test the inner workings of the function (rather than treating it as
   a black-box).
